{% comment %}

  This snippet is used to showcase each subcollection during the loop,
  'for product in collection.products' in collection.liquid.

  A liquid variable (grid_item_width) is set just before the this
  snippet is included to change the size of the container.
  Once the variable is set on a page, all future instances of this
  snippet will use that width. Overwrite the variable to adjust this.

  Example
    - assign grid_item_width = 'large--one-quarter medium--one-half'
